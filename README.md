the hello world tutorial example
I'm an aspiring programmer (and to a lesser extent, digital graphics designer), a career path I committed to about three months ago. 
I knew almost nothing about computers coding, or computer graphics software before that time but hope to be able to work as a professional 
within the next two years, through hard work and navie enthusiasm.
